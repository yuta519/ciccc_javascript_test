# 12- What data type would Array.map() and Array.filter() return?

Additionally what will be the output of this ?

```js
let array = [1,2,3, 0, 4,10, 0];
let output = array.filter((item) => item); 
```

## My answer
- They return array.
- The above will return `[1,2,3,4,10]` which has no false(0) value.
