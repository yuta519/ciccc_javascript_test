# 5- What does setInterval and setTimeout do?

## My answer
- setInterval()
  - `setInterval()` execute a function of 1st arg continues at intervals of 2nd arg.
  - `setInterval()` stop when you call `clearInterval()`.
- setTimeout()
  - `setTimeout()` set a timer with 2nd arg.
  - When a timer ended, it calls function of 1st arg.


# What will be the output of the following ?

## FIRST
```js
 for (var i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++) {
       setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(i);
}, 0);
}
```

## My answer
The output is ...
```js
5
5
5
5
5
```

This is because `var` is a function scope.
This code works:
1. In iterations, `var i` is added like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and ended.
2. After 1. iterations, setTimeout uses var i = 4 + 1 (means 5).
3. setTimeout works 5 times.

## SECOND
```js
 for (let i = 0 ; i < 5 ; i++) {
       setTimeout(() => {
       console.log(i);
}, 0);
}
```
## My answer
The output is ...
```js
0
1
2
3
4
```
This is because `let` is a block scope.
So after `let i` is added, setTimeout works immediately.
