# 1- What is ES6?

## My answer
- ES6 is short for ECMAScript 6. The 6th version of ECMAScript.
- It is also known as ECMAScript 2015.
- When Javascript was created, it was a completely non-standard language.
- Because Brendan Eich, who created Javascript, worked in Netscape, and the features were only for Netscape.
- So ECMAscript was created to standardise features of Javascript.
