# 3- What is the difference between let and const?

## My answer
- Re-assign
  - `let` is possible to reassign.
    ```js
      let variable_let = 'Yuta'
      variable_let = 'Prabh' // It works
    ```
  - `const` is impossible to reassign. Immutable.
    ```js
      const variable_let = 'Yuta'
      variable_let = 'Prabh' // It doesn't work
    ```
